There are total three processes going on the parent process, the child process and the grandchild process.There will be two cases of execution whether the grandchild finishes before the child process or the child process finishes before the grandchild process in the latter the grandchild will become orphan so it won't be able to exit and in the first case when grandchild process finishes before the child process both will execute properly and exit.
